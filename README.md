Wittbot 
==============

_Whereof one cannot tweet, thereof one must be silent_
------------------------------------------------------


A simple Ludwig Wittgenstein Twitter bot built with Tweepy and Beautiful Soup. Outputs lines from the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. If you know of an online version of the Philosophical Investigations that isn't just a PDF, do let me know.
